  * how flexible is admin/ -- can this all be done there?

* user authentication
  * SSO-linked?
  * Simplest possible!
  * critical for admin; just need an identity for enrollment
  * maybe moderator provides an example?

* enrollment
  * replace Alchemer with.. a regular old form (or a react app)

* pairing
  * provide data to a react app, allow filtering, etc.
