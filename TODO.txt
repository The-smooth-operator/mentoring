  * Simplest possible!
  * critical for admin; just need an identity for enrollment
  * use moderator example

* pairing
  * option to show existing pairings with "unpair" button
  * API method to create a pair
  * check in model that pair.mentor.role == MENTOR etc. and not already paired

* hardening
  * protect API with is_staff or something
  * use moderator as an example
  * CSP
  * django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware
  * clickjacking

* enrollment
  * replace Alchemer with.. a regular old form (or a react app)

* notes
  * provide a way to add notes to a participant (not via admin)

* emails
  * provide a way to create batches of emails and send them, and track what's
    been sent
